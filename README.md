# Building Games with Amazon Q CLI

This project demonstrates how Amazon Q CLI can help you build creative applications like games. In this example, we've created "Canvas Dreams" - an interactive art creation game using Pygame.

## How Amazon Q Helped

Amazon Q CLI assisted in:

1. Setting up the project structure
2. Installing necessary dependencies
3. Creating the game code with multiple drawing modes and features
4. Adding documentation and instructions
5. Making the game executable

## Canvas Dreams Game

Canvas Dreams is an interactive art creation game that allows users to:
- Draw with different artistic modes (standard drawing, spray, kaleidoscope, gravity)
- Customize brush sizes and colors
- Create symmetrical patterns
- Save artwork as PNG files

The game demonstrates creative coding concepts like:
- Particle systems
- Symmetrical pattern generation
- Interactive drawing tools
- Color manipulation

## Running the Game

To run the game:

1. Navigate to the canvas_dreams directory
2. Execute the run.sh script:
   ```
   cd canvas_dreams
   ./run.sh
   ```

## Game Controls

- **Mouse**: Draw with left button
- **Right Mouse Button**: Change to a random color
